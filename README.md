GPS Coordinate Extractor (On hold)
===========

The GPS Extractor allows you to use your finger to make any shape on a map in order to “Extract” GPS coordinates in various increments (feet, yards, meters, kilometers, miles). Before you would have had to have a computer to use special software that allows you to find coordinates anywhere on a map. With this app, you can get any coordinates of free hand drawing, straight lines, rectangles and circles, anywhere in the world, straight from your mobile phone.
